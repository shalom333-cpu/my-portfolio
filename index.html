    <p>Hey there, my name is <strong>Shalom Eberia Elijah</strong>. I am a kenyan citizen living in Nairobi Kenya. 
      I have a diploma in Business Information Technology from ST Paul's University and soon aspiring to undrertake my degree.
      As a hobbie and a skill i am a vocalist and i enjoy singing and listening to music. I also enjoy
      watching movies, especially comic based and action movies. Lastly and most important, i love comfort
      food. 
    </p>
    <p>I heard about <em>Moringa School</em> from a friend while i was doing my diploma. This friend 
      referred Moringa because of it's specialisation in educating people in programming and being good at
      it for that matter. Back i UNI at a diploma level there isn't much about programming that is taught,
      hence leading me here to Moringa. I aspire to be an all rounded IT profesional and joining Moringa is 
      my first step. I hope through Moringa i'll be one step closer to acheiving my dream
