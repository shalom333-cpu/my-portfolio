        Hey there, my name is <strong>Shalom Eberia Elijah</strong>. I am a kenyan citizen living in Nairobi Kenya. 
        have a diploma in Business Information Technology from ST Paul's University and soon aspiring to undrertake my degree.
        As a hobbie and a skill i am a vocalist and i enjoy singing and listening to music. I also enjoy
        watching movies, especially comic based and action movies. Lastly and most important, i love comfort
        food. 
      </p>
      <p>
        I heard about <em>Moringa School</em> from a friend while i was doing my diploma. This friend 
        referred Moringa because of it's specialisation in educating people in programming and being good at
        it for that matter. Back i UNI at a diploma level there isn't much about programming that is taught,
        hence leading me here to Moringa. I aspire to be an all rounded IT profesional and joining Moringa is 
        my first step. I hope through Moringa i'll be one step closer to acheiving my dream

      <h2>Trudy's Bakery</h2>
      <p>
        This page is a basic pastery blog page that seeks to pass information about people's opinions
        about various pastries. I used html and css to design it. 
        Have a look at <a href="https://github.com/shalom333-cpu/Trudys-bakery.git">Trudys-bakery</a> on github,
        review the code and help make it better.
      </p>
      <h2>My Pet</h2>
      <p>
        Just like Trudys-bakery, this site is also a blog on dogs which are my favourite pet. The page is not
        breed specific so any can headline on our blog oage. On our blog page we tell stories about dogs and owners who 
        have been through the worst by being separted from each other. I programmed it using html and css.
